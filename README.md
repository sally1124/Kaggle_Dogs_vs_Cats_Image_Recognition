# Kaggle_Dogs_vs_Cats_Image_Recognition

### Project Introduction
This project originated from a Kaggle challenge where the objective was to classify the image of cats and dogs. 

Kaggle challenge: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition/overview

# Dataset
The train folder comprises 25,000 images featuring dogs and cats, with each image filename indicating its respective label. \
The test folder contains 12,500 images identified by numeric IDs.\ 
The task is to predict the probability of each test image being a dog (1 for dog, 0 for cat).

# Model Development Approach
To build the model that can classify the images belonging to cats or dogs, I will leverage the Convolutional Neural Network and try different transfer learning model architectures to determine which model performs the best on the dataset.

Transfer learning model included:
1. ResNet 50
2. Xception
